# Battle Bound Restarted
Hello there! As some of you may know, @KIKOKO_'s Battle Bound game on Scratch was removed by the Scratch Team. Recently, the Scratch API was changed and unshared projects could no longer be seen on sites like Turbowarp and forkphorus. Then, I downloaded the project and converted it to HTML and now, its published on Github for everyone to see!
Thank you!
